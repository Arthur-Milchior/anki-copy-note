# Copy notes

The copy can have only new cards. Or they can have exactly the same
intervals, ease, etc... than the original card.

To copy a note:
1. Open the card browser
2. Select the desired notes (at least one card by note)
3. Go to "Edit > Copy and set to new" (Ctrl+C) or "Edit > Copy notes,
   keep interval" (Ctrl+Shift+C)

The copy preserve fields, tags, decks. 

## Warning
There is a potential caveat, which should not occur often nor have
real consequences. You should note that empty cards are not copied. If
you don't know what it means, you probably doesn't need to worry about
this. 

## Configuration
"Preserve creation time": as indicated by the name, if it's true, the card and note's creation time are preserved. Otherwise, it is set to the time of the copy.
